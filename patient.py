"""
Module defining the Patient class with urgency levels.

This module contains the Patient class which represents a patient in the
hospital urgency system. Each patient has a name and an urgency level
that determines their priority in the medical triage system.

Classes:
    Patient: Represents a patient with urgency-based priority.
"""


class Patient:
    """
    Represents a patient in the hospital urgency system.
    
    The Patient class encapsulates patient information and implements
    comparison operators for priority queue ordering. Lower urgency
    levels indicate higher priority (1 = highest, 5 = lowest).
    
    Attributes:
        name (str): The full name of the patient.
        urgency_level (int): Medical urgency level (1-5).
        URGENCY_LEVELS (dict): Class constant mapping levels to color codes.
    
    Constants:
        URGENCY_LEVELS: Dictionary mapping urgency levels to color names:
            1: "RED"    - Life-threatening emergency
            2: "ORANGE" - Emergency
            3: "YELLOW" - Urgency
            4: "GREEN"  - Minor urgency
            5: "BLUE"   - Non-urgent
    
    Example:
        >>> patient = Patient("MarÃ­a GarcÃ­a", 1)
